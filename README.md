# Data-Structure-Algo-Practice

A repository for **daily coding practice** in **DSA (C++)** along with experiments in **DevOps workflows**.

---

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `DSA C++/` ‚Üí C++ solutions to algorithm & data structure problems  
- `dsa.md` ‚Üí Log / notes of solved problems  
- `.github/workflows/` (or similar) ‚Üí DevOps / CI/CD workflow files  
- (other folders you might have, e.g. ‚Äúscripts‚Äù, ‚Äútests‚Äù, ‚Äúconfigs‚Äù, etc.)

## Goals & Philosophy

- Build consistency with **daily coding**  
- Improve **problem-solving skills** using DSA  
- Learn and practice **DevOps fundamentals** (CI/CD, branching strategies, workflow automations)  
- Maintain a **public log of growth & progress**

---

## Tech Stack & Tools

- **Languages**: C++  
- **Tools / Platforms**: Git, GitHub Actions (or whatever CI you use), docker / scripts / whatever tools you incorporate  
- **Focus Areas**: Algorithms, version control, continuous integration, deployment flows, branching

## How to Use / Contribute

1. Browse `DSA C++/` to see existing solutions.  
2. Check `dsa.md` to see your progress / problems solved log.  
3. Try solving a new problem, commit your solution, and update `dsa.md`.  
4. Use branching & workflow practices ‚Äî e.g. create a feature branch, open PR, let CI run, merge.  
5. Feel free to contribute ‚Äî fork the repo, add solutions / docs, open a PR.  
6. Keep naming consistent, write clear comments in code.
